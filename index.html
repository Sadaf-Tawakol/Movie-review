    <h4>2. STRANGE THINGS</h4>
    
       <p>Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's
         an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. 
         You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the 
         new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!</p>
         <strong>Here is it's official trailer.</strong><br>
